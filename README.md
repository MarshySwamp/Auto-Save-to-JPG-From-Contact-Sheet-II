# Auto-Save-to-JPG-From-Contact-Sheet-II
A hack to the Contact Sheet II script to auto save the generated docs to a user selected file

Extended code to the original Adobe script has been flagged using the following opening/closing comments:

////////// Original Script Extended 2021 - Stephen Marsh ////////// 

I have added a variable to select the folder to save the contact-sheets into. Ideally this would be removed and reference the source folder used to select the image files and name the contact sheets using the source folder name. Sadly this is beyond my current abilities.
